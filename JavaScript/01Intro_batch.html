        <h2>NodeJS</h2>
        <p>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source server environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.</p>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the
            World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.</p>
        <p>The JavaScript Engine is a program whose responsibility is to execute JavaScript code. All modern browsers
            come with their own version of the JavaScript Engine but the most popular one is Google’s V8 Engine. Google’s V8 engine powers Google Chrome browsers, as well as, Node.js. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that is used to build server-side applications outside of the browser.</p>
